# socialsensing_ncrm workshop

Jupyter workbook required for exercise analysing and mapping 'fracking' tweets.

Recommend creating a new virtual environment to run this workbook in.
Install any packages in the import list at the top of the workbook not already installed using pip or conda.

Tweet files have already been processed through the social sensing algorithm to filter for relevance and location in the UK. Each tweet contains location coordinates for it's inferred location.

You will also need to access the Google Drive folder link below containing:
- Filtered “fracking” tweets located in the UK - use files in UK Only folder.
- Shapefiles used in the jupyter notebook needed for mapping
